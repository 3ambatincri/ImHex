# How to Find Someone's ZIP Code
 
If you need to mail a letter or a package to someone in the United States, you will need to know their ZIP Code. A ZIP Code is a five-digit or nine-digit code that identifies a specific geographic area for postal delivery. ZIP Codes can also be used to find information about the demographics, climate, and services of an area.

But how can you find someone's ZIP Code if you only have their address, city, or state? There are several ways to do this, depending on how much information you have and how accurate you want to be. Here are some of the most common methods:
 
- **Use a ZIP Code lookup tool**. There are many online tools that can help you find a ZIP Code by entering an address, city, state, or country. For example, you can use the [ZIP Code Lookup tool](https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input) from the United States Postal Service (USPS) [^3^], the [Find a ZIP Code tool](https://qusps.usps.com/nationalpremieraccounts/findzipcodes.htm) from the USPS National & Premier Accounts [^1^], or the [Zip/Postal Code Lookup tool](https://worldpostalcode.com/lookup) from World Postal Code [^2^]. These tools will provide you with the five-digit or nine-digit ZIP Code for any valid address in the US or around the world.
- **Use a city/state/ZIP Code association tool**. If you don't have a specific address but you know the city and state of the person you want to mail to, you can use a tool that will show you all the ZIP Codes for that city. For example, you can use the [Find by City and State tool](https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input) from the USPS [^3^] or the [Cities by ZIP Code tool](https://worldpostalcode.com/united-states) from World Postal Code [^2^]. These tools will give you a list of all the ZIP Codes that cover a certain city and state.
- **Use a reverse ZIP Code lookup tool**. If you have a ZIP Code but you don't know what city or state it belongs to, you can use a tool that will show you the location of that ZIP Code. For example, you can use the [Find Cities by ZIP Code tool](https://tools.usps.com/go/ZipLookupAction_input) from the USPS [^3^] or the [Map Geolocation tool](https://worldpostalcode.com/united-states) from World Postal Code [^2^]. These tools will display a map of the area covered by the ZIP Code and provide you with information about the city, state, county, and other details.

Finding someone's ZIP Code can be easy if you use one of these methods. However, keep in mind that some addresses may have more than one ZIP Code, depending on the type of delivery service they use. Also, some ZIP Codes may cover more than one city or town, so make sure you have the correct name and spelling of the place you want to mail to. If you are not sure about the accuracy of your ZIP Code, you can always contact the USPS or check their website for more information.
